# Tryhard

**Tryhard** Tryhard is personal project for my hockey pool. It's a keepers pool so in order to better manage the pool I decided to create a web app that would help us create our keepers list. Also to practice back-end development skills such as database creation and API calls.

Created to practice on the back-end side of an web application

Tools & Technologies I'm working with Laravel, Composer, Sass, webpack.mix, Vue.js and Vuetify.
